# BLUEPRINT CLEANER

* This mod adds a little QoL to your **Crafting/Cooking Panels**.
* It lets you **hide/display the Blueprint/recipe you want** whenever you want to keep your panels as clean as possible.

## EXTENDED VIEW (VANILLA) & COMPACT VIEW (MOD)

* A key *('H' by default)* lets you toggle between the two views (Vanilla VS Mod).


**EXTENDED VIEW (VANILLA)**

**COMPACT VIEW (MOD)**

## BLUEPRINTS ARE STACKED BY RESULT & CRAFTING LOCATION
* Blueprints/recipes are stacked according to **Crafting/Cooking Result** (and **crafting location** too... sadly...).
* They can be identified at the end of their name as follows: *[1/3]* (which means the 1st blueprint among 3... no kidding...)
* You can switch between them with *('Left arrow' and 'Right arrow' by default)*.

**SECOND BLUEPRINT CURRENTLY DISPLAYED**

## HIDE/SHOW BLUEPRINTS
* You can hide blueprints/recipes in both views *('Left ALT' + 'LMB' by default)*
* Hidden blueprints will appear with a red background in the extended view.
* You can then display it again by clicking the same way on it. *('Left ALT' + 'LMB' by default)*

**TWO BLUEPRINTS HIDDEN STILL DISPLAY IN RED IN EXTENDED VIEW **

## KNOWN ISSUE :

BLUEPRINTS WITH DIFFERENT CRAFTING LOCATION CAN'T BE STACKED
In the case below there's two gunpowder blueprints crafted at the ammo workbench and two others crafted at the regular workbench leading to two different lines.
