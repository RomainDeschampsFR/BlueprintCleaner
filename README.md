# BLUEPRINT CLEANER

* This mod adds a little QoL to your **Crafting/Cooking Panels**.
* It lets you **hide/display the Blueprint/recipe you want** whenever you want to keep your panels as clean as possible.

## EXTENDED VIEW (VANILLA) & COMPACT VIEW (MOD)

* A key *('H' by default)* lets you toggle between the two views (Vanilla VS Mod).

## BLUEPRINTS ARE STACKED BY RESULT & CRAFTING LOCATION
* Blueprints/recipes are stacked according to **Crafting/Cooking Result** (and crafting location too... sadly...).
* They can be identified at the end of their name as follows: *[1/3]* (which means the 1st blueprint among 3... no kidding...)
* You can switch between them with *('Left arrow' and 'Right arrow' by default)*.

## HIDE/SHOW BLUEPRINTS

* You can hide blueprints/recipes in both views *('Left ALT' + 'LMB' by default)*
* Hidden blueprints will appear with a red background in the extended view.
* You can then display it again by clicking the same way on it. *('Left ALT' + 'LMB' by default)*
