# BLUEPRINT CLEANER

* This mod adds a little QoL to your **Crafting/Cooking Panels**.
* It lets you **hide/display the Blueprint/recipe you want** whenever you want to keep your panels as clean as possible.

## EXTENDED VIEW (VANILLA) & COMPACT VIEW (MOD)

* A key *('H' by default)* lets you toggle between the two views (Vanilla VS Mod).


### Extended view (Vanilla)

### Compact view (Mod)

## BLUEPRINTS ARE STACKED BY RESULT & CRAFTING LOCATION
* Blueprints/recipes are stacked according to **Crafting/Cooking Result** (and **crafting location** too... sadly...).
* They can be identified at the end of their name as follows: *[1/3]* (which means the 1st blueprint among 3... no kidding...)
* You can switch between them with *('Left arrow' and 'Right arrow' by default)*.

### Second blueprints currently displayed

## HIDE/SHOW BLUEPRINTS
* You can hide blueprints/recipes in both views *('Left ALT' + 'LMB' by default)*
* Hidden blueprints will appear with a red background in the extended view.
* You can then display it again by clicking the same way on it. *('Left ALT' + 'LMB' by default)*

### Two hidden blueprints still displayed in *red* in the extended view

### Both removed from the selection in the modded view

## KNOWN ISSUE :

### Blueprints with different *crafting location* can't be stacked
In the case below there's **two** gunpowder blueprints crafted at the **ammo workbench** and **two** others crafted at the **regular workbench** leading to two different lines displayed.
